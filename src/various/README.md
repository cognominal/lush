# Various

Stuff related to my workflow that does not really belong to lush and that would
be otherwise dispersed. I want to save them anyway as I have no public dotfiles
git repo.

[config.yml](./config.yml), a copy of `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml`. Generated
by codex. Extend lazygit to support git worktrees. Conflicting keybindings,
probably does yet not work but having a way to cleanly work with branches would
be nice.
